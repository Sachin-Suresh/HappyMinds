		Hybris with mysql
As we know that hybris suite by default provides HSQL database, 
so if we want to connect to MySQL database we need to do the following modifications:

in \hybris\bin\platform\project.properties
Comment the Database settings for HSQLDB
uncomment MYSQL settings 

Since hybris Commerce Suite version 5.0.2, MySQL connector is not shipped with the hybris Commerce Suite, 
Hence download the below mysql java connector:
MYSQL java connector link (https://mega.nz/#!BQYXGSIS!NXTu2tIQWbY5QnLiVrpj0Y5tNCTMql3ZcrufA5nQjmQ)

(With MySQL 5.6.4 (or later) the mysql.allow.fractional.seconds property must be defined. 
Before 5.6.4 you must either omit the mysql.allow.fractional.seconds property or 
set it for false! In project.properties file )

and place it in hybris/bin/platform/lib/dbdriver
and reload/build ant

Initialize the system in HAC
