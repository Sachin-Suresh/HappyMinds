1) Download magento 1x (w/o installing)
2) Download the sample data(Place the zip in the folder other than the installation folder)
	a) Extract them and copy the folders ‘media’ and ‘skin’ to the magento installtion’s root folder

3) Create a DB and import the SQL dump you see on the extracted folder of magento’s sample data.
